This application, developed using React Native and Expo, provides a seamless experience for a single-deck, single-player blackjack game. The codebase leverages advanced techniques, including state manipulation, hooks, and event handling. It efficiently retrieves deck information from a JSON file and accesses card images stored locally. To enhance the gaming experience, players automatically receive $1000 in virtual currency if their balance reaches zero, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay.
