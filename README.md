# Blackjack

This application is developed using React Native and Expo, offering a streamlined experience for a single deck, single player blackjack game. The codebase incorporates advanced techniques such as state manipulation, hooks, and event handling. It efficiently reads deck information from a JSON file and accesses card images stored in a local directory. Additionally, to enhance the gaming experience, players are automatically provided with $1000 in virtual currency if their balance reaches zero, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay.
